# Record of eth learning process

I will continue until I get first job with this.

## Start

* Code the first section of the [CryptoZombie](https://cryptozombies.io/en/) to learn Solidity.
* Follow [Dapp Tutorial](https://www.dappuniversity.com/articles/the-ultimate-ethereum-dapp-tutorial) to set up development environment with Promise API.(The last process is outdated?, Some Solidity syntax is different from current version.)
* Read [React example.](https://www.dappuniversity.com/articles/ethereum-dapp-react-tutorial)
* Code the second section(truffle, ganache) of the [CryptoZombie](https://cryptozombies.io/en/) course.
* [Read the official documenation for Solidty](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html) and [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/debugging-your-contracts)
* You can inherit from the existing contracts. Read [OpenZepplin Documenation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/3.x/) and find more.
