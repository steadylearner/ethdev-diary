I will continue until I get the first eth job with this. If I will, you can also get a job following this repoitory.

## Start

* [Search and read information for Object Oriented Programming.](https://www.google.com/search?&q=what+is+obejct+oriented+programming)

* Follow [Dapp Tutorial](https://www.dappuniversity.com/articles/the-ultimate-ethereum-dapp-tutorial) to set up development environment with Promise API.(The last process is outdated?, Some Solidity syntax is different from the current version.)
* Read [React example.](https://www.dappuniversity.com/articles/ethereum-dapp-react-tutorial)

## Code

* Make your first project.
* [Read the source code of Solidity patterns.](https://github.com/fravoll/solidity-patterns)
