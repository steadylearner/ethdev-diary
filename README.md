* Follow [Dapp Tutorial](https://www.dappuniversity.com/articles/the-ultimate-ethereum-dapp-tutorial) to set up development environment with Promise API.(The last process is outdated?, Some Solidity syntax is different from current version.)
* Read [React example.](https://www.dappuniversity.com/articles/ethereum-dapp-react-tutorial)
* Code the second section(truffle, ganache) of the [CryptoZombie](https://cryptozombies.io/en/) course.
